        a simple utility to send commands to sio2pc and get the
        status of its drives.  Works just like the remote utility
        that game with sio2pc but it gets its commands from the
        command line for convenice of SpartaDos users. It even has a
        way to perform a cold start afterwards so you can load a disk
        as D1: and reboot. (to run it)
