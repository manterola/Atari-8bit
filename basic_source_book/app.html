<p align="right"><b><font face="sans-serif" size="7">The Bugs in 
Atari BASIC </font></b></p>


Yes, it's true. There are some bugs in Atari BASIC. Of course,
that's not surprising, since Atari released the product as ROM
without giving the authors a chance to do second-round bug-
fixing. But what hurts, a little, is that most of the fixes for the
bugs have been known since June of 1979.
    As this book is being written, rumor has it that at last Atari
is in the final stages of releasing a new version of the BASIC
ROMs. Unfortunately, these modified ROMs will appear too
late for us to comment upon them in this edition. On the other
hand, there are supposed to be fewer than twenty fixes
implemented (which isn't a bad record for a product as mature
as Atari BASIC), so those of you who are willing to PEEK
around a bit can use this listing as at least a road map to the
new ROMs.
    In any case, though, we thought it would be appropriate to
mention a few of the bugs we know about, show you why they
exist, and tell how we fixed them back there in the summer of
'79.

<b>The Editing and String Bug</b>
In the course of editing a BASIC program, sometimes the
system loses all or part of the program, or it simply hangs.
Often, even SYSTEM RESET will not return control to the user. 
    Also, string assignments that involve the movement of 
exact multiples of 256 bytes do not move the bytes properly. 
For example, A$=B$(257,512) would actually move bytes 513 
through 768 of B$ into bytes 257 through 512 of A$, even if 
neither string were DIMensioned to those values.
    Both of these are really the same bug. And both are caused 
because we strove to be a little too efficient.
    There are many ways to move strings of bytes using the 
6502's instruction set. The simplest and most-used methods, 
though, are excruciatingly slow. So Paul and Kathleen 
invented a super-fast set of move-memory routines, one for


	275


<hr noshade size="15" width="100%" align="right" color="black">
<font size="4"><b>Appendix B</b></font>
<a name="276">

moving up in memory (EXPAND, at $A881) and one for 
moving down in memory (CONTRACT, at $A8FD). 
Unfortunately, the routines are very complex (which is what 
makes them fast) and difficult to interface with properly. And 
so a bug crept into CONThACT
    Take a look at the code of FMOVER ($A947). When we get 
here, we expect MVLNG to contain the complement of the least 
significant byte of the move length while MVLNG+ 1 contains 
its most significant byte. But look what happens if the original 
move length was, for example, $200. The complement of the 
least significant byte ($00) is still zero ($00), so the BEQ to 
:CONT4 occurs immediately.
    But by then, the X register contains the number of pages to 
move plus one (X would contain 3 in this example), so we 
increment it (it becomes 2) and go to label :CONT3, where we 
bump the high-order byte of both the source and destination 
addresses. Ah, but therein lies the rub! We haven't yet done 
anything with the first values in those source and destination 
addresses, so we have effectively skipped 256 bytes of each!
    The solution is to replace the BEQ :CONT4 at $A94E with 
the following code:
    DEX
    BNE :CONT2
    RTS
    Do you see the difference? If we enter with MVLNG equal 
to zero, we immediately move 256 bytes (at : CONT2) before ever 
attempting to change the source and destination addresses.
    And this fix works, honest. We've been using it like this for 
over two years BASIC A +.

<b>Minus Zero</b>
Taking the unary minus of a number (A=0 : PRINT -A) can 
result in garbage. Usually, this garbage will not affect 
subsequent calculations, but it does print strangely. And how 
did this come about?
    We simply forgot to take into consideration the fact 
that zero doesn't really have a sign. Look at the code for the unary 
minus operator (XPUMINUS, at $ACA8). Do you see the 
problem? We simplyinvert the most significant bit (the sign bit) 
of the floating point number in FRO.

<hr noshade size="15" width="100%" align="right" color="black">

<a name="277">

    What we should have coded would be something like this:
      LDA   FRO
      BEQ   :NOINJERT
      EOR   #$80
      STA   FRO
    :NOINVERT
    Luckily, this is not too severe a problem to the BASIC user 
(one can always use "PRINT 0-A" instead of "PRINT A") 
but just think  it only cost two bytes to fix this bug.

<b>LOCATE and GET</b>
The GET statement does not reinitialize its buffer pointer, so it 
can do nasty things to memory if used directly after a statement 
which has changed the system buffer pointer. For example, 
GET can change the line number of a DATA statement if it is 
used after a READ. Also, the same problem exists for the 
LOCATE statement, since it calls GET.
    From BASIC, the easiest solution is to use a function or 
statement which is known to reset the pointer. Coding 
"XX"' STR$(0)" works just fine, as does PRINTing 
any number.
    Within the source listing, the problem exists at location 
$BC82, label GETi. If the code had simply read as follows, 
there would be no bug:

    GET1
      JSR INTLBF; reset buffer pointer 
      LDA #ICGTC; continue as before

<b>INPUT and READ</b>
Using either an INPUT or READ statement without a following
variable does not cause a syntax error (as it should). Then,
attempting to execute a statement such as 20 INPUT can cause
total system lock-up.
    The solution from BASIC? Be careful and don't do it.
    And this is one bug that we will not show the fix for,
simply because it's too long and involved. We will, however,
point to labels SINPUT and :SREAD (at locations $A6F4 and
$A6F5) in the Syntax Tables and show why the bug exists.
    Note that the SINPUT does a syntax call (SYN JS,) to the
:OPD syntax, which looks for  but does not insist upon - a
file number specifier (# < numeric expression>). Then the


	277


<hr noshade size="15" width="100%" align="right" color="black">
<font size="4"><b>Appendix B</b></font>
<a name="278">

syntax joins with :SREAD, which looks for zero or more 
variables.
    Oops! Zero or more? Shouldn't that be one or more? That's 
where the problem lies.

<b>Do <i>Not</i> Use NOT</b>
In all too many cases, the use of the NOT operator is 
guaranteed to get you in trouble. If you don't believe it, try 
this: PRINT NOT NOT 1.
    The explanation of why the bug occurs is too lengthy to 
give in detail here; suffice it to say that the precedence of NOT 
is wrong. Remember the Operator Precedence Table we 
displayed in Chapter 8 of Part 2? Look at what you got for the 
go-onto-stack and come-off-stack precedence values for NOT.
    Or look at location $AC57, the NOT entry in OPRTAB. 
NOT uses a 7 for both its precedence values. But wait a minute. 
If two operators have the same apparent precedence (as in 
NOT NOT A or even A + B + C), the expression executor will 
pop the first one off the stack and execute it. But with a unary 
operator, there is nothing to execute yet.
    And the same bug exists for both unary minus and unary 
plus, so - -3 and + + 5 don't execute properly. Of course, since 
unary plus doesn't really do anything, it doesn't matter. In the 
case of unary minus, though, all but the last minus sign in a 
string of minus signs is ignored (that is, - -3 produces -3 as a 
result, instead of + 3, as it should). But, by an incredible 
coincidence, the damage that unary minus causes is invisible to 
Execute Expression as a whole and only produces the error 
noted.
    The fix? Well, if we want to leave NOT where it is in the 
order of things, the only way is to restructure the whole 
precedence table. But if we are willing to accord it a very high 
precedence, like unary plus and minus, we can fix it - and 
plus and minus - by changing the bytes at $AC57, $AC64, 
and $AC65 to $DC. And, thanks to the differing go-onto-stack and 
come-off-stack values, we can stack as many NOTs, pluses, or 
minuses as we want.
    Are these all the bugs we know about that can be fixed 
easily? No. But these are the easiest to understand or the 
easiest to fix, and we thought they were instructive.
    Of course, unless you have an EPROM board and burner 
handy, you may not be able to take advantage of these fixes.

But at least now you may be able to work around them as you 
program with good old buggy-version Atari BASIC.
    And take heart. Remember Richard's Rule: Any nontrivial 
piece of software has bugs in it. And the corollary: Any piece of 
software which is bug-free is trivial.
