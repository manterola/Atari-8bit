Build 114

- Results after each round are displayed in the right
  sequence, i.e. the best one is on the top
- during second and following rounds shooting sequence
  is such that the worst tank shoots first
The above changes does not look terrific, but there was
a lot of thinking to do it correctly. What is the most
important the overall game feeling improved a lot!

program.s65
	* added routine SortSequence
textproc.s65
	* changed routine DisplayResults to show
	  round results in correct order

Build 113
2003-08-17
- AI Opponents move barrels to the right position
  before firing a bullet.
- Purchase screen is not displayed for AI opponents.
- There is 2 sec delay after displaying
  "Deffensive" text i.e. text before death

program.s65
	* added routine MoveBarrelToNewPosition
	  which rotates barrel of the tank until
	  it sits at the right (newly randomized) angle
textproc.s65
	* added routine PurchaseAI
	  it is a framework for all AI purchases
SHORTSYS.S65
	* new macro PAUSE (waits given number of frames)

First attempts to create a framework for intelligent
opponents (AI). Right now there is only one level
of "intelligence" - Moron. Moron shoots at random angle
with random force.

program.s65
	* routine Round checks the Skill level
	  and if it is not human branches to
	  ArtificialIntelligence routine.
	* new routines:
	  - ArtificialIntelligence
	  - RandomizeForce
	  - RandomizeAngle

TO DO:
	* nice rotating barrel of AI tank
	* AI weapon purchase and usage
	* AI better than Moronic... (but how...)
	* tanks' shooting seqence shoud be from
	  weakest to the strongest, not random

program.s65:
	* added sequentional shooting
	  (not necesarily tank nr 1 shoots first)
	* added routine "RandomizeSequence" that is called
	  before each round
	* initial angle of the tank's barrel is randomized
	  (was always 45 degrees right)
variables.s65
	* added table "TankSequence"
grafproc.s65
	* shorter delay during Flight
